 Shell Scripting Final Project
-----------------------------

Project Name: Close symptom events

Assume that we have a monitoring tool, and this monitoring tool collecting events from many sources like servers 
each event express the status of the source which came form it,
ex: unix server_1 fired event for diskspace issue 
another event say there is an issue due to buffering  and so on...

each event open a incident number express issue, and when the issue resolved it should close the events and close the incident

but we have an issue:

in some cases the incident got resolved but event still opened in the monitoring tool

we need to check the status of each incident (closed or opened) then if the incient is closed so you need to close the event 
and if the incident is opened so you will do nothing 

-------------------------------------------------------------

1- create a new file called (ticket_status) 
   in the file write multible incident numbers like (INC0000401355) and write the status of it infront of the incidnt

ex: INC0000401355  opened
    INC0000401340  closed
    INC0000401356  closed

--------------------------------------------------------------
2- creat a file called ( events_tickets.txt )

in the file, write the event id and those incident number, write 10 ids

ex: INC0000401355          6192fd9a-9b03-71ec-01b9-0a4e23470000 
    INC0000401340          6192fd9a-9b03-71ec-01b9-0a4e23454213
    ...
    ...
----------------------------------------------------------------

create  script to ask the user to enter the incident number 
then take the incident number and check if it is closed or open 
and if it's closed so create new file called events_status.txt and write the event of the desired incident number which came from the user and write infront of it (closed)
and print the event and status to the user 

and if the incident is opened so do nothing and print the event to user and ensure that th event is still open


ex:

Events_status.txt 
------------------

6192fd9a-9b03-71ec-01b9-0a4e23470000  closed
